A Sudoku puzzle uses a 9 × 9 grid in which each column and row, as well as each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids, must contain all of the digits 1 ⋯ 9.  The figure below  presents an example of a valid Sudoku puzzle. This project consists of designing a multithreaded application that determines whether the solution to a Sudoku puzzle is valid.
